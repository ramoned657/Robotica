	abstract = {Simulation for medical and healthcare applications, although still in a relatively nascent stage of development, already has a history that can inform the process of further research and dissemination. The development of mannequin simulators used for education, training, and research is reviewed, tracing the motivations, evolution to commercial availability, and efforts toward assessment of efficacy of those for teaching cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardiology skills, anaesthesia clinical skills, and crisis management. A brief overview of procedural simulators and part-task trainers is also presented, contrasting the two domains and suggesting that a thorough history of the 20+ types of simulator technologies would provide a useful overview and perspective. There has been relatively little cross fertilisation of ideas and methods between the two simulator domains. Enhanced interaction between investigators and integration of simulation technologies would be beneficial for the dissemination of the concepts and their applications.},

	abstract = { This paper presents the design of a fault detection and diagnosis system for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle under partial or total actuator fault. In order to control the quadrotor, the dynamic system is divided in two subsystems driven by the translational and the rotational dynamics, where the rotational subsystem is based on a linear parameter-varying model. A robust linear parameter-varying observer applied to the rotational subsystem is considered to detect actuator faults, which can occur as total failures (loss of a propeller or a motor) or partial faults (degradation). Furthermore, fault diagnosis is done by analyzing the displacements of the roll and pitch angles. Numerical experiments are carried out in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. }

El enfoque propuesto se basa en la técnica de Análisis en Componentes Principales (PCA). Con este método se extraen datos de velocidades angulares en los tres ejes de rotación considerando condiciones nominales libres de fallas y se construye un modelo implícito del mismo a través de la extracción de características de los datos, proyectando estos en el subespacio PCA. El procedimiento se repite considerando fallas en cada uno de los cuatro actuadores del VANT. Los resultados se comparan para discernir en qué condición de operación se encuentra el vehículo (nominal o con falla). Finalmente, se presentan resultados de diferentes experimentos sobre un sistema real que consiste de un cuatrirrotor montado sobre un giroscopio mecánico de tres grados de libertad, demostrando la efectividad del método propuesto.}

	abstract="Quadrotor UAVs have successfully been used both in research and for commercial applications in recent years and there has been significant progress in the design of robust control software and hardware. Nevertheless, testing of prototype UAV systems still means risk of damage due to failures. Motivated by this, a system for the comprehensive simulation of quadrotor UAVs is presented in this paper. Unlike existing solutions, the presented system is integrated with ROS and the Gazebo simulator. This comprehensive approach allows simultaneous simulation of diverse aspects such as flight dynamics, onboard sensors like IMUs, external imaging sensors and complex environments. The dynamics model of the quadrotor has been parameterized using wind tunnel tests and validated by a comparison of simulated and real flight data. The applicability for simulation of complex UAV systems is demonstrated using LIDAR-based and visual SLAM approaches available as open source software.",

This issue plays a great role in the safety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to the need of continuous supervision and control of these systems. In order to have a cyber-attack tolerant (CAT) controller, the attack and the type of attack should be detected in the first step. This paper introduces a new algorithm to detect fault data injection attack in UAV. An adaptive neural network is used to detect the injected faults in sensors of an UAV. An embedded Kalman filter (EKF) is used for online tuning of neural networks weights; these online tuning makes the attack detection faster and more accurate. The simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully detect FDI attacks applied to an UAV.},

Both actuator and sensor faults of a UAV are considered as an agent node fault on the system of UAVs in the formation flight. The CKF based fault detection scheme developed is used in order to detect a system wide fault in the formation flight. Furthermore, the graph theoretic approach used for modeling the multi agent UAV's communication is exploited to isolate the faulty UAV (node) from the flight formation. A numerical simulation is presented to confirm the proposed fault detection and isolation (FDI) performance.},

	abstract = {The growing tendency in the number of distributed generation units, directly connected at the distribution level, inevitably brings a number of new challenges. One of the effects is that this new topology may influence the performance of analysis methods and techniques that were based on traditional systems. Fault location methods in distribution systems are examples of how inserting of new generation sources can change the efficiency of these tools. Considering that fault location is a fundamental step to help distribution companies to maintain reliability indices within acceptable margins, this work presents a method applicable to both traditional systems and systems with the presence of distributed generators. In order to achieve this goal, a methodology was developed based on artificial immunological systems technique, which is generally used to complex problems-solving. The methodology evaluated considering several scenarios in the test system and presented a satisfactory performance, being able to estimate characteristics such as location, fault type and fault resistance in an efficient way.},

The core purpose of condition monitoring systems, proactive fault diagnosis, is essential in ensuring UAV safety in these applications. In this research, adaptive health monitoring systems perform blade balancing fault diagnosis and classification. There seems to be a bidirectional unpredictability within each, and this paper proposes a hybrid-based transformed discrete wavelet and a multi-hidden-layer deep neural network (DNN) scheme to compensate for it. Wide-scale, high-quality, and comprehensive soft-labeled data are extracted from a selected hovering quad-copter incorporated with an accelerometer sensor via experimental work. A data-driven intelligent diagnostic strategy was investigated. Statistical characteristics of non-stationary six-leveled multi-resolution analysis in three axes are acquired. Two important feature selection methods were adopted to minimize computing time and improve classification accuracy when progressed into an artificial intelligence (AI) model for fault diagnosis. The suggested approach offers exceptional potential: the fault detection system identifies and predicts faults accurately as the resulting 91% classification accuracy exceeds current state-of-the-art fault diagnosis strategies. The proposed model demonstrated operational applicability on any multirotor UAV of choice.},

However, the development of best practices for high quality of UAV mapping are often overlooked representing a drawback for their wider adoption. UAV solutions then require an inter-disciplinary research, integrating different expertise and combining several hardware and software components on the same platform. Despite the high number of peer-reviewed papers on UAVs, little attention has been given to the interaction between research topics from different domains (such as robotics and computer vision) that impact the use of UAV in remote sensing. The aim of this paper is to (i) review best practices for the use of UAVs for remote sensing and mapping applications and (ii) report on current trends - including adjacent domains - for UAV use and discuss their future impact in photogrammetry and remote sensing. Hardware developments, navigation and acquisition strategies, and emerging solutions for data processing in innovative applications are considered in this analysis. As the number and the heterogeneity of debated topics are large, the paper is organized according to very specific questions considered most relevant by the authors.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the primary source of income in developing countries like India. Agriculture accounts for 17 percent of India’s total GDP, with almost 60 percent of the people directly or indirectly employed. While researchers and planters focus on a variety of elements to boost productivity, crop loss due to disease is one of the most serious issues they confront. Crop growth monitoring and early detection of pest infestations are still a problem. With the expansion of cultivation to wider fields, manual intervention to monitor and diagnose insect and pest infestations is becoming increasingly difficult. Failure to apply on time fertilizers and pesticides results in more crop loss and so lower output. Farmers are putting in greater effort to conserve crops, but they are failing most of the time because they are unable to adequately monitor the crops when they are infected by pests and insects. Pest infestation is also difficult to predict because it is not evenly distributed. In the recent past, modern equipment, tools, and approaches have been used to replace manual involvement. Unmanned aerial vehicles serve a critical role in crop disease surveillance and early detection in this setting. This research attempts to give a review of the most successful techniques to have precision-based crop monitoring and pest management in agriculture fields utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft. The researchers’ reports on the various types of UAVs and their applications to early detection of agricultural diseases are rigorously assessed and compared. This paper also discusses the deployment of aerial, satellite, and other remote sensing technologies for disease detection, as well as their Quality of Service (QoS).},

The UDE technique robustifies the NDI based controller by providing estimate of the lumped or total disturbance thereby enabling rejection of the same. The effectiveness and benefits of the proposed scheme are confirmed through six–DOF simulations considering nonlinear quadrotor dynamics under ideal as well as perturbed flight conditions. Further, the efficacy and superiority of the proposed control scheme are validated through Monte–Carlo simulations and experimental validation on Quanser’s 3–DOF Hover setup.},

However, these operations involve potential risks for humans and the electrical structure. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to reduce the risk of these tasks is rising. This paper presents an UAV to autonomously clean insulators on power lines. First, an insulator detection and tracking algorithm has been implemented to control the UAV in operation. Second, a cleaning tool has been designed consisting of a pump, a tank, and an arm to direct the flow of cleaning liquid. Third, a vision system has been developed that is capable of detecting soiled areas using a semantic segmentation neuronal network, calculating the trajectory for cleaning in the image plane, and generating arm trajectories to efficiently clean the insulator. Fourth, an autonomous system has been developed to land on a charging pad to charge the batteries and potentially fill the tank with cleaning liquid. Finally, the autonomous system has been validated in a controlled outdoor environment.},

	abstract="Quaternions are an alternative to the classical Euler angles for mathematically describing mechanical systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this chapter, the most important concepts of unit and dual quaternions are explained to give a clear basis for readers when working with quaternions. In the first section, unit quaternions are presented to describe a simple yet complete dynamic model for the rotational and translational dynamics of UAVs. In the second section, dual quaternions are explained, which are useful when describing robotic systems with multiple rotations and translations. The dynamic model and a controller example are developed in both sections to illustrate each approach.",
